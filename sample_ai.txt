    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world. Machine learning, a subset of AI, 
    enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Deep learning uses neural 
    networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns.
    
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand human language.
    It powers applications like chatbots, translation services, and sentiment analysis.
    
    Computer vision is another important AI field that enables machines to interpret visual information.
    It's used in facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging.
    
    The future of AI includes advancements in quantum computing, edge AI, and explainable AI systems.
